ToDo List:

screenscraper.fr
	-We need to edit the download settings to account for all possible options
	-we need to set backup options if the primary dosent exist
	-We need to add in the backup options logic when moving the images
	-hardcode in the dev SS login info and purge it from the cached xml files then re-add them if using cached data
		(maybe we encrypt the xml files?)
	
	Scraping:
		Saving the updated gamelist is broken
		When scraping folders as a Rom, some games have no "ROM" info in the xml reply, need to add that to standardize workflow
		example:
				<Data>
					<jeu>
						<rom> <--- Add this entry if it dosent exist w/ the romfilename!
							<romfilename>Filename.ext</romfilename>
						</rom>
					</jeu>
				</Data>
	
From the Main UI 
	- UI is painfully slow when loading large libraries of roms. Consider lazy loading, or cache the file structure on 1st load for faster indexing subsuqent uses
	- we need to fix / remove some options (mostly in the toolpanel -> Scrape)
	- Add a panel that blocks the viewable meta data or add the data to a panel?
	- Redo the Manual/Video labels as imageboxes
	- setup the hash found label and show values if present
	- figure out how to scale everything if we stretch the window
	- Add meta data for the consoles like we do the games 
	- Create a new variable for a .GameList to be stored on the console node like we do a scraped .Game on the game nodes? (would replace the dictionary)
	- When in Edit mode make shown pics able to be deleted.
	- Add blank picture box to upload custom images
	
From the Context Menu
	- Fix the scrape options to do multi if multiple are selected	-Done (i think)
	- Fix Delete File, Rename File, Delete Cache - add to main UI
	- Add funtion in rebuild to do multiple files
